          In memoriam of retired Navy Chief Hospital Corpsman (HMC), Heidi Sharon
          Amato, who passed after her 2nd battle with cancer in June 2019.
          “Heidi’s House” is a pilot program by W.A.G. Healing to explore and
          strengthen the Human and Animal bond toward healing. The first “tiny cabin” will
          be built to temporally house Mack & Stella (Heidi’s surviving furry animals) and
          provide space for both animals and visiting Volunteer Caretakers to heal and
          connect.
